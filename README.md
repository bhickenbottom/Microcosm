# Microcosm
A simple way to deploy static websites on Docker.

## How do I use this?

This is the source for the Microcosm docker container on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bhickenbottom/microcosm).

Once the container is deployed, go to `/portal` to upload your content.

You'll need an Auth Key, which is specificied using the `AuthKeySHA512` environment variable.

Simple!

## Akash

The repo also contains an example SDL file for [Akash](https://akash.network/).
